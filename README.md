Trivia Game

This deep sea trivia game inspired by Molly's spirit animal, the colossal squid, is pure html, CSS, and JQurey. By incorporating a timer, and JQuery the user is able to play a 10 question game that will display the final results at the end of the game. See images of what play looks like.
